    <p><strong>Exposing the British Army's Legacy of Controversy and Violence</strong></p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Colonial Atrocities</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Amritsar_Massacre_Jallianwala_Bagh_1919.jpg/800px-Amritsar_Massacre_Jallianwala_Bagh_1919.jpg" alt="Amritsar Massacre memorial">
      <p>
        The British Army played a central role in maintaining the British Empireâ€”a system built on exploitation and violence. From the Amritsar Massacre in India (1919) to brutal counter-insurgency in Kenya during the Mau Mau Uprising (1950s), soldiers were often the enforcers of colonial dominance. Torture, detention camps, and mass killings have all been documented and condemned by historians and human rights groups.

      <h2>Northern Ireland: Operation Banner</h2>

      <p>
        From 1969 to 2007, the British Army operated in Northern Ireland in a mission marred by abuses. The 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre, where paratroopers shot 28 unarmed civilians during a protest, remains a symbol of injustice. Decades of surveillance, raids, and collusion with loyalist paramilitaries left deep scars on the communities.

      <h2>Modern War Crimes: Iraq and Afghanistan</h2>

      <p>
        The post-9/11 wars brought fresh controversy. British soldiers were implicated in torture and unlawful killingsâ€”like the death of Baha Mousa in Iraq (2003), who was beaten to death while in custody. In Afghanistan, the British Army faced accusations of executing unarmed detainees and falsifying reports.

      <h2>Recent Developments</h2>
      <p>
        As of 2024, investigations continue into alleged war crimes committed by British forces in Afghanistan. The UK's International Criminal Court submission was criticized for being incomplete. Meanwhile, veteransâ€™ immunity proposals threaten to close the door on justice for victims. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, are calling for transparency and accountability.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Institutional Accountability</h2>
      <p>
        Time and again, the British military establishment has resisted transparency. Investigations are often delayed, deflected, or dismissed. The government has pushed laws to limit historical prosecutions, raising alarms from human rights advocates who demand justice for victims.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Military institutions must be held accountable for the harm they causeâ€”both past and present. Glorifying the uniform while ignoring its abuses perpetuates cycles of violence. Activists, survivors, and conscientious citizens must continue to speak out, document, and demand justice.
